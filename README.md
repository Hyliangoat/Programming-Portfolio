-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. They desired a gaming application that could host multiple users from different networks that draw from one single library of images to play a timer-based guessing game.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I did particularlt well on my research during this documentation. There were many things I didn't innately know about different server companies, OS specifications, and capabilties that I spent a lot of time researching so that I could consult the client on their desired software specs.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The ordering of the document seemed to flow very well. Starting at the original overview, moving through things like the flowchart and the innate specifications required, then into a compare and contrast chart, finishing at my actual recommendations. Using this type of document and work flow really helped the consulting process flow smoothly.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Probably the initial compare and contrast section, now that I know so much more about the systems that I recommended later on in the assigment.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted their needs based on what they actually requested me and a ton of researched information on what operating systems, APIs, and operating concepts work best with that they want. It took a lot of time and effort to make sure they got the best recommendations based on the multi-user server system they were requesting.


-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Initially I approached designing software as a "throw the entire sink at it and fix the problems later" approach, but now I think I'll take a bit more time to plan out and design my process. Knowing what I know now about servers, clouds, and these individual operating systems, I realize there is much more to be gained by pre-planning and doing a bit more research before starting the devoloping process.
