#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was an application for a grocery store that required a program that would allow them to keep track of items purchased in their store. The goal of the program was to allow the user to see what items were purchased (as a whole or individually), how many were purchased, to display a visual histogram for the items, and to write all data to a file for the user.

#What did you do particularly well?
I felt I organized my code well and allowed the program to do as much as possible without the user having to do any extra work. For example, the project did not specifically ask for an updateable list that can add or subtract items. The project only asked for the ability to read a very strict list of items. But my program allows the user to add as many possible items to the list and it will add all of them to the total. I feel like my error correction is also pretty good. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would like to spend more time on pointers and the like to enhance the optimization of my program.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging parts would probably be the formatting on the C++ side. Things like colored text are not exactly an easy resource to use and understand. I had to search through a variety of different websites with documentation to find one that could suit my needs. The same goes for text formatting on the Python side when it came to writing to files.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project taught me how to combine two languages together and use the strengths and weaknesses of either one accordingly. I feel that this will be useful in all further coursework when combining languages becomes the commonplace.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Spacing, comments, and vague decision makers like switches. I kept it as readable as possible while commenting on the vast majority of elements, and I used decision makers like switches so the program can easily be adapted to add or subtract more options.
