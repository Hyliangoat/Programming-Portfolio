How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User stories are essentially a break down of these user needs. They are simple to digest, short paragraphs or sentences, that turn the user needs into something of a psuedo code with a "why" at the end. These user stories take the users needs from a vague desire and turn   it into something a programmer or developer can easily understand and implement. They take all of the guesswork out of the desire, and the "why" allows the tester to easily understand how another human being, or the user themselves, would attempt to use this feature.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I personally approach them head-on, starting almost immediately on the text editor to begin creating code through a constant success/failure cycle. In my own way, I feel like this is close to the agile process innately. I tend to do things in short rushes, taking what
  know to be a smaller feature, aggressively coding in as many possible solutions as I can until one works, learning from those mistakes, then continuing to the next feature. This method is nothing like the waterfall method, something I would be terrible at, that            requires immense amounts of planning and forethought into a project. I do this because knowing how many roadblocks I've faced in the past, the waterfall method has always seemed like a waste of time. Why would I go through so much effort planning when I already know    I will eventually have some sort of coding failure and have to do something akin to agile in order to fix it? I apprecaite what I've learned from agile because of this.

  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Transparency and an ability to take criticism. A team works best when all members can be constructively vocal about the entire process of the project. When all members know their place, and the places of those around them, and feel like they are able to voice concerns or ask for help, the project will move significantly smoother. In a software development world, there is no place for rigidity and hard coded rules. Teams should flow together like a swarm of bees, constantly working together towards one objective.
